# MP3 Splitter for Children's Stories

![Project Logo](./images/mp3-splitter-logo.png)

The **MP3 Splitter for Children's Stories** is an open-source Node.js project designed to enhance the storytelling experience for children using devices like the Toniebox. This project allows you to effortlessly split longer MP3 files, such as children's stories, into a series of shorter MP3 chunks. These segmented chunks can then be loaded onto compatible devices, enabling children to conveniently navigate forward and backward through story segments without the need to restart from the beginning with every listen.

## Features

- **Segmentation:** The MP3 splitter takes a longer MP3 file and divides it into smaller, manageable segments. This ensures that children can easily navigate to specific parts of the story.

- **Customization:** Tailor the number of segments according to your preferences. You can determine how many segments each story should have, to suit your child's listening habits.
